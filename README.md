In order to analyze the data for Hollywood, I sorted the entire Los Angeles dataset to focus on Hollywood and N Hollywood, as those were the reporting areas used in the dataset to represent Hollywood. The dataset came free from data.lacity.org

Mainly, this code contains some data cleaning and sorting, and data visualizations in the form of line, bar, and pie charts to make the data more understandable at a glance.

We were interested in seeing the trends in which crimes occurred most often, and what may have contributed to these trends. We were interested in time of year/social climate, and time of day.
